  <h3>Project "Remote Monitoring" Overview</h3>
  <div class="title-border"></div>
</div>
<p class="leading">
  This project represents a production-grade Kubernetes-based backend infrastructure designed to support scalable web applications with emphasis on asynchronous processing, robust job scheduling, and real-time log streaming. The architecture is modular and decouples key components to ensure maintainability and extensibility across services.
</p>
<h3>Core Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Job Scheduling:</strong> Celery Beat is integrated for time-based and recurring task execution, ensuring scheduled jobs are persisted and coordinated with the MySQL database layer.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous Task Management:</strong> Celery Workers handle background job execution triggered by user actions or scheduled jobs. Redis acts as a reliable broker with persistent backup for durability.</li>
    <li><strong>Log Management with SSE:</strong> Server-Sent Events (SSE) are used to push real-time logs and status updates from the backend to remote clients for improved observability.</li>
    <li><strong>Multithreaded Log Reading:</strong> A dedicated log reading service processes application logs using multithreading, enhancing throughput and responsiveness in streaming logs to clients.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcheck API &amp; Error Management:</strong> A well-defined healthcheck API endpoint monitors the status of core services. Errors are logged and handled gracefully, providing actionable insights for infrastructure observability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Deployment Overview</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> Includes NGINX for static asset serving and a Django application for dynamic content. The application is exposed through dedicated Kubernetes services for load balancing and routing.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage Layer:</strong> A shared persistent volume is mounted for the Django application and a separate standalone job responsible for database migrations.</li>
    <li><strong>Async Processing:</strong> Celery Beat and Celery Workers operate in a dedicated processing zone, backed by a Redis deployment with persistent volume support.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Layer:</strong> MySQL is used as the core relational database with direct integration for job scheduling and data persistence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This architecture ensures high availability, scalability, and observability, aligning with modern DevOps and microservices principles for cloud-native applications.
